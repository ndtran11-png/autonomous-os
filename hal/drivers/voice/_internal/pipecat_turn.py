"""Pipecat turn handling — the cascaded twin of realtime_turn.py.

Same contract (drive one turn, return a RealtimeTurnResult) over a different
input: the finished STT transcript instead of committed audio. There is no
native-audio path, no look-replay and no WS-recovery retry — a cascaded brain
has no session to lose, and an empty transcript means there is simply nothing
to send.

The wait filler, thinking cue and CoT leak filter are shared with realtime_turn
so both brains feel identical to the user.

    ElevenLabs v3 uses (see system_prompt_pipecat.md's Allowed Audio Tags), so
    the leak is fixed AND the emotional colour survives. Any other emotion is
    SUPPRESSED from the text instead: face presets like `thinking` or
    `greeting` mean nothing to a synthesizer, and emitting `[thinking]` just
    trades a spoken JSON blob for a spoken word. See _EMOTION_DELIVERY_TAGS.

    Either way the face still fires under `fire=True` — suppression drops the
    text, never the expression.

    `fire=True` additionally fires the real express_emotion side effect (the
    face/LED) via the same _fire_emotion() a correct tool call uses — the
    model's intent lands twice: once as a delivery cue in speech, once
    physically. Call with fire=True exactly once per leaked marker — at the
    site that actually speaks the text — so it doesn't double-fire when the
    same raw text is ALSO cleaned for the saved transcript.

    The other three tool names have no natural delivery-tag equivalent —
    their arguments carry real intent (a message, a capture, a query) that
    isn't safe to reconstruct from malformed text — so those are stripped
    entirely, same as an express_emotion leak with no parseable emotion.
