"""Acoustic echo cancellation for the mic path (WebRTC AEC3).

Provider-independent: the reference is tapped at the TTS output stream, so it
covers synthesized speech, queued speech and realtime native audio alike.

Requires `aec-audio-processing` (SWIG binding over libwebrtc-audio-processing-2).
It is NOT a hal dependency — absent or unloadable, every entry point here
degrades to a no-op and the voice path behaves exactly as before.
