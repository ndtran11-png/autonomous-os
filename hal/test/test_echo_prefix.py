"""Stripping the reply's own tail off the front of a transcript.

A turn captured on the heels of a reply opens with a pre-roll that starts
BEFORE the user did, so the last words of that reply sit in front of theirs. The
existing whole-transcript filter (sensing_sender.is_echo) cannot help: it drops
the transcript entirely, which would throw the user's turn away with the echo.

Every case here is a transcript observed on lamp-0c89, 27/08/2026.
